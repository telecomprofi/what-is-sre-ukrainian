## SRE goals

* Reduce silos between Devs and Ops
* Share Responsibility of Service with Devs (SLO, Err budgets)
* Balance feature delivery velocity with enough reliability to make most of end-users happy
* Accept Failure as Norm, learn from mistakes, adjust 
* Insted of *blaming* people for service failures/outages, improve processes and software (Blameless post-mortems/RCAs)
* Promote safe psychological env (Speak up, learn from mistakes, no hindsight bias/discomfort discharge)
* Promote gradual change/experimentation, canarying (CI/CD, test/deploy to 10% before full-production, then rollback if failed)
* Share Knowledge (cross-training, network of learning, g2g)
* Use Design Thinking (see below) & Prototype

* Work time breakdown
 - Work 50% of the time automating toil (Reduce Toil)
 - Other 50% of the time work towards increasing reliability of services (Communicates extensively with Devs, QA, PdM, Architects)
 
* Design Thinking
